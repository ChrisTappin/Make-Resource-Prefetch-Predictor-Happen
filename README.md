# Make-Resource-Prefetch-Predictor-Happen
Decode Resource Prefetch Predictor artefacts from protobuf blobs found inside Network Action Predictor SQLite databases.

Note: All files (except __init__.py) found in the 'supporting' subdirectory are excerpts of source code from [the Chromium open-source browser project](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:) (.proto) or python files derived from those excerpts using [protoc](https://protobuf.dev/installation/) and therefore subject to the same licence of this source code. A copy of the Chromium licence file can be found in the same directory.
